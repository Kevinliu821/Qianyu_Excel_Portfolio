Scenario:
Your company is implementing a new Expense Management system that can automate the process of
employees submitting home office or travel expenses and managers reviewing and approving them for
payment.
The new system is licensed from the vendor on a per-user and per-month basis, so when an employee
submits an expense, your company is charged for that use of the system. However, the vendor offers a
discount if a customer company signs a contract guaranteeing a minimum number of users according to
a tiered user structure. For example, if the contract specifies at least 25 users will submit expenses in a
month (Tier 1), the per user rate is $15.50; if the contract specifies at least 100 users (Tier 4), the per
user rate drops to $6.50 per user. There is also an annual system access fee that is charged regardless
the number of users, that differs according to the tier of service.
In determining which tier to sign up for, you estimated the number of users who would regularly use the
expense system. You found that 35 employees regularly submit expenses, but also found that the other
95 employees submit expenses occasionally
